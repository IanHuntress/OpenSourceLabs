    project ideas:
    -aggregation of resources from the web, like what can you do with deep dream API
    -rasberry pi and image processing seem interestingly interconneced, what kind of data 
    from the RP could a GPU do something with. process written notes from class with google?
    get more info to define any interesting words written in notes?
    -A game that uses OpenGL to simulate something intersting, like cutting down a tree, or blacksmithing, or destruction


first day:
    I have not infrequently manually "pattern matched" files, never again. #grep
    git stuff
        clone, pull, push, commit, add, branch
        Git is all about allowing many people to work on the same code at the same time.
        Users duplicate the project, contribute to it, and merge their contributions with the
        master project stored on github
    linux stuff
        apt-get, cd, ls, mkdir, tree
        Using linux as a platform gives access to a metric boat-load of tools required for "a stack"
    regular expressions stuff
        \d,\w,[],{},.,?
        Regular expressions help with the constant need to interpret strings, for example pairing through
        user input looking for useful info
