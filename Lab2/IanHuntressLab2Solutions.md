### This Lab (on 9/11/2015) is on Open Source Licensing.
### A good reading material is http://opensource.org/licenses

1. Read the four criteria for Free Software http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html

  Freedom to use the software for any purpose
  Freedom to study and modify the software
  Freedom to redistribute
  Freedom to redistribute modifications

2.  Why it is important to choose a LICENSE - write two to five sentences

  If a programmer does not choose a license, by default the law expects that they reserve all rights.
By default they are most restrictive, most detrimental to the open source community. Paying attention
to what rights are and are not assigned to users helps the community and prevents situations like 
SailfishOS from repeating themselves.

3.  Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have a explicit license - write two to five sentences.

  Any time a programmer uses someone elses work within their own, they should be aware of the effects on their
rights. If a large company uses code without a liscense, they are violating copyright law and opening themselves
up to lawsuits.

4. Read http://ils.unc.edu/callee/gopherpaper.htm#explain - Failure to follow the Open System Model Section - why Gopher failed and HTTP survived - Do you agree with this claim?
write two to five sentences.

  The difference between Gopher and HTTP was system indexing. HTTP embedded links in webpages, relying on the authors to
handle navigation. Gopher indexed webpages in a system external to the content of the authors, relying on administrators
to maintain navigation. The analysis seems consistent with Darwanism, programs growing and shrinking based on the selective
pressures of the environment, in this case, represented by the users.

45.  Android uses Apache license 2.0 and for kernel GPL v2 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)), Linux uses GPL v2 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux ) license, 
Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license ( https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr ), SailfishOS is not open source ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailfish_OS ).  Can you justify why
such a license is chosen (Justify for ONE  is enough). Instead of these four, you can look at any other software project and justify the license chosen for that project.

    The Android Apache License 2.0 seems make the Android operationg system very open and accessible to developers in the community.
    It encourages the system to grow and spread, while simultaneously allowing for the profit oriented App systems to adopt
    more proprietary licenses. By only holding onto trademark rights on the platform, but creating space for proprietary software,
    Google is essentially ensuring that it will remain in control of the money-making apps, without restricting users or developers.


5.  Have them pick a license (as a group) using the LICENSE chooser by Github: http://choosealicense.com/

6.  Read these licenses  GPL, LGPL and Apache/BSD and discuss which one will be better - for a developer, for a company and for the common good - Present at the end of the class (10 minutes per group)

7.  Justify their choice of the LICENSE (as a class).

8.  Write five sentences about choosing a project to work in this course and who will be your partners and what technology stack you want to use  and what license will you choose.
