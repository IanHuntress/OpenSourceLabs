### This Lab (on 9/11/2015) is on Open Source Licensing.
### A good reading material is http://opensource.org/licenses

1. Read the four criteria for Free Software http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html

  Freedom to use the software for any purpose
  Freedom to study and modify the software
  Freedom to redistribute
  Freedom to redistribute modifications

2.  Why it is important to choose a LICENSE - write two to five sentences

  If a programmer does not choose a license, by default the law expects that they reserve all rights.
By default they are most restrictive, most detrimental to the open source community. Paying attention
to what rights are and are not assigned to users helps the community and prevents situations like 
SailfishOS from repeating themselves.

3.  Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have a explicit license - write two to five sentences.

  Any time a programmer uses someone elses work within their own, they should be aware of the effects on their
rights. If a large company uses code without a liscense, they are violating copyright law and opening themselves
up to lawsuits.

4. Read http://ils.unc.edu/callee/gopherpaper.htm#explain - Failure to follow the Open System Model Section - why Gopher failed and HTTP survived - Do you agree with this claim?
write two to five sentences.

  The difference between Gopher and HTTP was system indexing. HTTP embedded links in webpages, relying on the authors to
handle navigation. Gopher indexed webpages in a system external to the content of the authors, relying on administrators
to maintain navigation. The analysis seems consistent with Darwanism, programs growing and shrinking based on the selective
pressures of the environment, in this case, represented by the users.

45.  Android uses Apache license 2.0 and for kernel GPL v2 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)), Linux uses GPL v2 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux ) license, 
Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license ( https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr ), SailfishOS is not open source ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailfish_OS ).  Can you justify why
such a license is chosen (Justify for ONE  is enough). Instead of these four, you can look at any other software project and justify the license chosen for that project.

    The Android Apache License 2.0 seems make the Android operationg system very open and accessible to developers in the community.
    It encourages the system to grow and spread, while simultaneously allowing for the profit oriented App systems to adopt
    more proprietary licenses. By only holding onto trademark rights on the platform, but creating space for proprietary software,
    Google is essentially ensuring that it will remain in control of the money-making apps, without restricting users or developers.


5.  Have them pick a license (as a group) using the LICENSE chooser by Github: http://choosealicense.com/

    MIT license seems to be a likely choice for an Open Source class project. It would allow students to 
    contribute to the community freely, without the danger of either being pulled into a lawsuit, or 
    inadvertantly making their work useless by restricting accessibility.

6.  Read these licenses  GPL, LGPL and Apache/BSD and discuss which one will be better - for a developer, for a company and for the common good - Present at the end of the class (10 minutes per group)

    Is the license best suited to a company the most restrictive available? The best way to make money is
    by charging for a service of course, but Google released most of their Android code for no charge. 
    Therefore, the best license for a company is more likely a balance suited to the market, a balance of 
    users gained by low barrier to entry and profits from users retained. This means a combination of no 
    license, and or GPL, LGPL
    
    The public good is surprisingly not best served by the least restrictive licenses. The GPL taps the 
    public capacity for progress, but also ensures that the work of the public stays in the public. It 
    prevents the community from breaking up into competitors. 
    
    The choice of the developer is certainly personal and based on software context. A developer can 
    be a company, a member of the community, or an independant. Their needs depend on who they want 
    to see their work. If their goal was to maximize profits, they would behave like a company; if their 
    goal was to help people, they would work with the community. 

7.  Justify their choice of the LICENSE (as a class).
  We did this, we were group 6

8.  Write five sentences about choosing a project to work in this course and who will be your partners and what technology stack you want to use  and what license will you choose.
  Our table seems to hold a common interest in javascript. Our current projects include board games, 3d multiplayer simulatious, and similar.
  Probably we would want to freely distribute such a game under the MIT license.
